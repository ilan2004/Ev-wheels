  maxFileSize?: number; // in MB
  className?: string;
}

interface MediaCategory {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  icon: React.ReactNode;

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Direct Upload (Detail Pages)
```typescript
const handleMediaUpload = async (files: File[], category: string) => {
  // Determine type based on category
  let attachmentType: 'photo' | 'audio' = 'photo';
  if (category === 'voice-notes') {
    attachmentType = 'audio';
  }

  // Upload to API
  const res = await serviceTicketsApi.uploadAttachments({
    ticketId: ticket.id,
    files,
    type: attachmentType,
    caseType: 'vehicle',
    caseId: vehicleId
  });

  // Refresh list
  if (res.success) {
    const listed = await serviceTicketsApi.listVehicleAttachments(
      ticket.id,
      vehicleId
    );
    if (listed.success && listed.data) {
      setAttachments(listed.data);
    }
  }
};
```

### Collection Mode (New Ticket)
```typescript
const [collectedFiles, setCollectedFiles] = useState<
  Record<string, File[]>
>({});

const handleFileCollection = async (files: File[], category: string) => {
  // Store files by category
  setCollectedFiles((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [category]: [...(prev[category] || []), ...files]
  }));
};

// Later, on form submit:
const allPhotos = ['vehicle-exterior', 'vehicle-interior', 'battery', 'electrical']
  .flatMap((cat) => collectedFiles[cat] || []);

const allAudio = ['voice-notes']
  .flatMap((cat) => collectedFiles[cat] || []);

// Upload all at once
await serviceTicketsApi.uploadAttachments({
  ticketId: newTicketId,
  files: allPhotos,
  type: 'photo'
});
```
